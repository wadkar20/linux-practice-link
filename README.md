## Hierarchy Of Linux file system :
1) /root ------- root directory is a home directory of root user *
2) /home ------ it is a home directory of local users*
3) /etc ------- it stores all configurations files of system and services *
4) /bin ------- it stores binary files, binary file means nothing but our commands (local user commands)
5) /sbin ------ it stores system binary executable files, commands----- (root user command)
6) /var ------ it stores variable data such as, mail, logs, messages etc.... *
7) /lib32 ------ library file information, support 32 bit commands
8) /lib64 ------ library file information, 64 bit supporting files 
9) /boot ------- it store boot loader and other booting files that helps to start our system
10) /dev ------- it stores device related information, usb drives, printer, 
11) /media ----- information of removable devices, card reader, pen drives, floppy disk
12) /sys ------- system related information
13) /run ------ store the information of all running devices
14) /proc ----- it stores the process related information, it store information related RAM and CPU
15) /tmp ------ it stores temporary file for 10 days
16) /usr ------ it store user related information, man pages
17) /srv ------ it stores service related information
18) /mnt ------ it store mount point for our storage devices ex : hard disk*
19) /opt ----- optional directory, addon services information

## Managing Users and Permissions in Linux :-

       A user is a person who utilizes a computer or network service. Linux is said to be secure 
       because one user cannot access files of other user without its permission. There are three types of user, 

       1. Super user/root user: Super users are those users who has all privileges of Linux system. On all 
          Linux systems, by default there is the user root, also known as the super user. This account is used for 
          managing Linux. Root, for instance, can create other user accounts on the system. For some tasks, 
          root privileges are required. Some examples are installing software, managing users, and creating 
          partitions on disk devices.  

       2. System user: System accounts are used by the services in Linux system. These 
          accounts or users generally created when services are installed in system. 

       3. Standard user(Local user): local user accounts or standard user accounts are for the people who 
          need to work on a system and who need limited access to the resources on that system. These user 
          accounts typically have a password that is used for authenticating the user to the system.

      1. Username: This is a unique name for the user. User names are important to match a 
         user to his password. On Linux, there can be no spaces in the user name. 
      2. Encrypted password: This field contains all that is needed to store the password in a secure way. 
      3. Days since Jan 1, 1970, that the password was last changed: Many things on Linux 
         refer to this date, which on Linux is considered the beginning of days. 
      4. Days before password may be changed: This is minimum age of password. That means user cannot change password,
         before the mentioned days, after immediately changing the password. Typically this field is set to the value 0. 
      5. Days after which password must be changed: This field contains the maximal validity 
         period of passwords or maximum age of password. User must have to change their password after mentioned days. 
         By default it is set to 99999 days. 
      6. Days before password is to expire that user is warned: This field is used to warn a 
         user when a forced password change is upcoming. By default it is set to 7 days. 
      7. Days after password expires that account is disabled: Use this field to enforce a 
         password change. After password expiry, users can no longer log in. 
      8. Days since Jan 1, 1970, that account is disabled: An administrator can set this field to 
         disable an account. This is typically a better approach than removing an account, as 
         all associated properties and files of the account will be kept, but it can be used no 
         longer to authenticate on your server. 
      9. For future use: This is reserved field for future use. 
## commands :
   syntax; 
   chage <option> <parameter> <username>

   chage -l <username> ------- list the password onformation
   chage -m <username> ------- change minimum days between password change
   chage -M <username> ------- maximum password age
   chage -W <username> ------- warning days
   chage -I <username> ------- password inactive days
   chage -E <username> ------- account expired
